# SpotWelder2.0

##A Brief Description of the project

This project aims to bring features only found in a welder costing thousands of dollars to the Hobbyist and Maker Markets, and provide a serviceable and powerful machine for their use.  

**Some unique, and high end features include the following:**

* Single, Dual, and Manual Pulse welding programs.
* Trigger Delay, Pulse Length(s), and Inter-Pulse length are all configurable.
* Has a unique 'Scrolling' Menu Interface that uses an Encoder and two buttons.
* Includes a screensaver function for use with VFD Displays to prevent Burn in.

The schematics and circuit board include provision for contact detected weld triggering, safety, and foot-switch control of the welding system.

The design will eventually include a few different probe types and styles for different use
cases, such as battery tab attachment, wire fusing, panel and sheet welding etc.

##Structure of the Project Repository

The folder "Spotwelder" contains the control code as an Atmel Studio Project.

-> _Note that this is for ATMEGA XX4 series Parts (644, 324, 164 etc). XX8 series parts do not have enough digital IO._

Other folders for the Schematic, Mechanical Design, etc will be added as they are made available.
